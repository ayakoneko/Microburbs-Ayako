# 🏡 Rental Income Efficiency Score (RIES)

This project was created as part of the **Microburbs Analyst Developer Technical Test**.  
It calculates a **Rental Income Efficiency Score (RIES)** for Australian suburbs, helping property investors identify areas that generate stable and efficient rental returns.

---

## 📘 Overview
The **RIES** model combines:
- **Net Rental Yield** – measures rental return relative to property value  
- **Cash Flow Margin** – shows how much rent remains after expenses  
- **Occupancy Rate** – indicates how consistently properties stay rented  

These are normalized and weighted to create a single **efficiency score** for each suburb.
